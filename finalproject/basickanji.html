					<h2 class="text-info">What Is Kanji?</h2>
						<p class="text-justify">You may be wondering what Kanji is. This is where we will be going more in depth into the subject. First, some history. What we know today as "Kanji" 漢字 originated in China (they call it hànzì). These hànzì characters made their way through the Korean Peninsula, then hopped over to Japan mostly via Classical Chinese religious texts. Japan was very much in love with China at the time they adopted the Chinese writing system and applied it to their own language. Taking the meanings of the Chinese hànzì and applying them to the Japanese language was fairly straightforward. If you saw the character 食, you'd know the meaning was "meal," "food," or something along those lines.But the sounds of the Chinese language and the Japanese language are completely different. Despite this, Japan went ahead and adopted the Chinese readings for the Kanji too.</p>
						<p class="text-justify">When you start learning Japanese, you first learn Hiragana, and then you learn Katakana, and then - the dreaded Kanji! While Hiragana and Katakana can both be sounded out by syllable, Kanji must simply be memorized. And as soon as you start memorizing Kanji, you realize that there is more than one way to say almost all of them! Some have even more than 10 pronunciations!  ひらがな・かたかな (Hiragana and Katakana) are children which made in Japan in the long history.</p>
						<ul>
								<li class="text-justify"><strong>Hiragana</strong> - It is the most frequently used script today, said to have been invented in the 9th century by a Buddhist priest. There are 46 basic Hiragana symbols, and these can be combined together to create many different sounds. Reading hiragana is quite simple, as each symbol has just one pronunciation not unlike the letters of the English alphabet. For example, あ、い、う、え、お correspond to “a,” “i,” “u,” “e” and “o” respectively. There are also “vowels” in the Japanese language, though there are nuanced differences from English in their pronunciation. Hiragana also has strong ties to the basics of the Japanese language. There are many words that are only written in hiragana, such as basic grammatical units (は、に、を、と、で, etc.), greetings, and some onomatopoeia.</li>

										</ul>
									</ul>
								<li class="text-justify"><strong>Katakana</strong> - Katakana (or カタカナ) is a writing form that has its origins in the Heian period, 794-1185 AD. It was used to aid the reading of Kanji, but today it is used most often to denote words imported from foreign countries. Like hiragana, there are 46 basic katakana symbols in the Japanese language with each symbol corresponding to a syllable. Katakana is also used for native Japanese words in some circumstances. Sometimes, it is to emphasize a word. For example, まじ？(seriously?) can become マジ？in a manga script. Onomatopoeia can also be written in katakana, usually for an emphatic effect. </li>

										</ul>
									</ul>
						</ul>
						<p class="text-justify">Kanji has two kind of pronunciations - On’Yomi (音読み) and Kun’Yomi (訓読み). The first one came from China with the Kanji character and the second one was made in Japan. Kanji can have multiple On’Yomi or Kun’Yomi readings, and sometimes they might only have On’Yomi or Kun’Yomi readings. Kanji has multiple pronunciations and it makes more difficult to master for learners.</p>
						<ul>
								<li class="text-justify"><strong>On’Yomi</strong> - So, long ago, before Japan had a written language, Chinese characters started making their way across the sea from China to Japan. Japan began to adopt those characters in their own language and tried to use the Chinese pronunciations too. But of course, Japanese sounds different from Chinese so they didn’t always get it exactly right. On’Yomi is the basically the Japanese version of the Chinese reading. So for example the On’Yomi for the Kanji 山 (which means ‘mountain’) is サン. Seems simple enough.
																					Except to top it all off, different accents and dynasties and pronunciations all came over for hundreds of years and Japan decided to keep them ALL. So, many Kanji you see may have multiple On’Yomi!
																					For example, the On’Yomi for 木 (which means tree) are “モク” or “ボク.” When you say 木ようび (Thursday) , you should pronounce “モクヨウビ,” while たい木 (big tree) should be “タイボク.” Same Kanji, different words, different pronunciations.</li>
								<li class="text-justify"><strong>Kun’Yomi</strong> - Kun’Yomi is the JAPANESE pronunciation for words that already existed before the written Chinese language came over. So since Japanese already had a word for “person” the Kun’Yomi for the Kanji 人 is ひと. There can also be multiple Kun’Yomi for a Kanji, just because they like to make things difficult. But we’ll get in to more detail on that in a bit.</li>

										</ul>
									</ul>
						</ul>
						<p class="text-justify">The Japanese government selected 1945 Kanji to be used for official publications. These so called “toyo Kanji”, also known as the Tōyō Kanjihyō (当用漢字表, "list of Kanji for general use"), which are also used for the Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPT) have around 4000 readings. They were replaced in 1981 by the Jōyō Kanji 常用漢字, literally "regular-use Chinese characters") is the guide to Kanji characters and their readings. Current jōyō Kanji are those on a list of 2,136 characters issued in 2010. It is a slightly modified version of the tōyō Kanji, which was the initial list of secondary school-level Kanji standardized after World War II. The list is not a comprehensive list of all characters and readings in regular use; rather, it is intended as a literacy baseline for those who have completed compulsory education, as well as a list of permitted characters and readings for use in official government documents. Due to the requirement that official government documents make use of only jōyō Kanji and their readings, several rare characters are also included by dint of being a part of the Constitution of Japan, which was being written at the same time the original 1850-character tōyō Kanji list was compiled.</p>
						<ul>
							<li class="text-justify"><strong>The 2,136 Kanji in the jōyō Kanji consist of:</strong></li>
								<ul>
									<li class="text-justify"><i>1,006 Kanji taught in primary school (the kyōiku Kanji).</i></li>
									<li class="text-justify"><i>1,130 additional Kanji taught in secondary school.</i></li>
									<li class="text-justify"><i>Foreign learners of Japanese also often focus their Kanji studies on the jōyō Kanji list.</i></li>
