<h3>What Is Japanese?</h3>
	<p>Japanese (日本語 Nihongo) is the main spoken language of Japan used by almost all of its inhabitants. It has no <i>official</i> status, but is the de facto national language of Japan. It is a no genetic relationship with Chinese, however, it makes a good use of Chinese Characters, or kanji (漢字), in its written system, and even borrows a large portion of the Chinese vocabulary around the 4th century CE. Along with kanji, there are two syllabic (or moraic) writing systems Japanese use - the  hiragana (ひらがな or 平仮名) and katakana (カタカナ or 片仮名).</p>
	<p>The hyōjungo (標準語), which means "standard Japanese", or the kyōtsūgo (共通語), which means "common language", are considered standard in the language.  There are dozens of dialects, which are often mutually unintelligible, but standard Japanese is used a lot in many types of broadcasting and understood nationwide. There are two major dialects: Hondo and Nantō. The Hondo dialect is mostly used throughout Japan and it is mainly divided into three major sub-dialects: <a>Eastern</a> <i>(which was established in the 7th and 8th centuries)</i>, Western <i>(where in the 17th century had a influx of the Kamigata (Kinai) sub-dialect which was long the standard language of Japan)</i>, and Kyushu <i>(it restrains some of the 16th-century form of the language and has been placed outside the mainstream of linguistic change of this dialect).</i>The Nantō dialects are used mainly by the Okinawa islanders that are from the Amami Islands in the Kagoshima prefecture to the western end of the archipelago. These types of dialects have been placed outside the mainstream of linguistic change for a long time and still retain their ancient forms.</p>
	<p>Learning Japanese can be tough but that is because there are many mental barriers and misconceptions that need to be jumped over. This language has a reputation for being hard to learn and that understandable. There are a bunch of new characters to learn, a grammatical structure different from other languages, and don't even get on about kanji - the main thing that can scare off potential students. However, Japanese is rather straight-froward and easy to learn, especially when you compare Japaneses to other languages. There are three things to show the that: Phonology, Grammer, and Kanji. Japanese phonology (sounds that make up the language) is simple with the basic five vowels sounds and the consonants as well. Compared to English phonology, it's much more complex then Japanese. Though, when speaking Japanese your voice's pitch does matter but its not as pronounced as tonal languages. Now, grammer! Japanese grammer is simple. You won't have to do that subjunctive tense that English uses or the different nouns for different genders that is used in languages like Spanish or French. That's something you don't need to do in Japanese! Isn't that wonderful? Now, if have not been scared off by this then we're going into the boogeyman of the Japanese language: kanji. It's actually pretty easy to learn and technology has made that a whole lot easier. You won't need to memorize each stork needed for kanji; now, you can type it!</p>
	<p>Don't be wrong though, Japanese can be a struggle. Of course, no language is objectively easier then another. But learning one can be an experience. So, give it a shot. Who know? You could find learning Japanese to be a breeze!
